Two dimensional optimisation algorithm using the [Cross Entropy Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy_method).
Data is fitted to a [Beta Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) in the algorithm. Parameters and the [fitness function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function) can easily be changed.
